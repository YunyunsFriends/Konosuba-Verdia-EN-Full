## Launcher Change Log:

- Replaced Japanese text with English translations.
- Added a default controls option in the Keyboard/Gamepad config.
	- This option was added due to it not being possible to configure the gamepad controls on the Steam Deck.
- Removed the ability to resize the launcher window.
- Removed leftover Steamworks integration for Pharaoh Rebirth.
- Due to issues with virus scanners flagging the newly compiled executables as malicious, the launcher has been compiled to load an external data file and modules to combat this issue.

	- The final cutscene has a character's sprite change one line earlier.
- Slightly adjusted the level design of the Opening Stage to teach the player how to use the dash jump.

	- Stage 6 - Closed Room, Escape, Confrontation, Behind the Truth.

## Known Issues:

- There is a possibility to damage the Giant Toads with Create Water. (Original Release Bug)
- Skill text may disappear when pressing Attack to consume an HP or MP restoring item while in the selection menu. (Original Release Bug)
- "Nature's Wonders" may do slightly more damage than the original release.
- In the launcher, the "Use D-pad Input" option does not function properly on the Steam Deck, use controller remapping or keyboard input to use the d-pad.
- On the Steam Deck, the font used for the parts of the copyright text and level difficulty text is not available/does not function properly under W.I.N.E./Proton and will not display certain Unicode characters.
- Utilizing other translations' dial.dat files will result in a few timing issues with cutscenes, while not game-breaking this mod was made with our own translation in mind.
